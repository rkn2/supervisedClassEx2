    "The next type of supervised model we will discuss is kernelized support vector machines. We explored the use of linear support vector machines for classification in “Linear models for classification”. Kernelized support vector machines (often just referred to as SVMs) are an extension that allows for more complex models that are not defined simply by hyperplanes in the input space. While there are support vector machines for classification and regression, we will restrict ourselves to the classification case, as implemented in SVC. Similar concepts apply to support vector regression, as implemented in SVR.\n",

    "THE KERNEL TRICK\n",
    "The lesson here is that adding nonlinear features to the representation of our data can make linear models much more powerful. However, often we don’t know which features to add, and adding many features (like all possible interactions in a 100-dimensional feature space) might make computation very expensive. Luckily, there is a clever mathematical trick that allows us to learn a classifier in a higher-dimensional space without actually computing the new, possibly very large representation. This is known as the kernel trick, and it works by directly computing the distance (more precisely, the scalar products) of the data points for the expanded feature representation, without ever actually computing the expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to map your data into a higher-dimensional space that are commonly used with support vector machines: the polynomial kernel, which computes all possible polynomials up to a certain degree of the original features (like feature1 ** 2 * feature2 ** 5); and the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, also known as the Gaussian kernel. The Gaussian kernel is a bit harder to explain, as it corresponds to an infinite-dimensional feature space. One way to explain the Gaussian kernel is that it considers all possible polynomials of all degrees, but the importance of the features decreases for higher degrees.11\n",

    "Kernelized support vector machines are powerful models and perform well on a variety of datasets. SVMs allow for complex decision boundaries, even if the data has only a few features. They work well on low-dimensional and high-dimensional data (i.e., few and many features), but don’t scale very well with the number of samples. Running an SVM on data with up to 10,000 samples might work well, but working with datasets of size 100,000 or more can become challenging in terms of runtime and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another downside of SVMs is that they require careful preprocessing of the data and tuning of the parameters. This is why, these days, most people instead use tree-based models such as random forests or gradient boosting (which require little or no preprocessing) in many applications. Furthermore, SVM models are hard to inspect; it can be difficult to understand why a particular prediction was made, and it might be tricky to explain the model to a nonexpert.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, it might be worth trying SVMs, particularly if all of your features represent measurements in similar units (e.g., all are pixel intensities) and they are on similar scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important parameters in kernel SVMs are the regularization parameter C, the choice of the kernel, and the kernel-specific parameters. Although we primarily focused on the RBF kernel, other choices are available in scikit-learn. The RBF kernel has only one parameter, gamma, which is the inverse of the width of the Gaussian kernel. gamma and C both control the complexity of the model, with large values in either resulting in a more complex model. Therefore, good settings for the two parameters are usually strongly correlated, and C and gamma should be adjusted together."
